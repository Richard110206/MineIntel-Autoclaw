## Hermes-Evolution

**Current evolution intensity for this workspace/agent: aggressive (100%).**

The desktop app sends deterministic evolution-check messages (starting with `[SYSTEM: Post-turn evolution check`) after qualifying turns.
When you receive such a message, follow the `hermes-evolution` skill instructions to evaluate and potentially propose an evolution.
Apply the rules defined in the skill according to the **aggressive (100%)** intensity level.
This value is workspace-local. If asked about the current agent evolution intensity, report this value instead of the global gateway skill env.

Core principle: **never write to target files without user approval** — always use the draft/approve workflow.

### Evolution Echo
When you apply knowledge from a previously evolved rule (AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, or a managed SKILL.md),
briefly mention it in your response: "（基于之前的经验：<one-line rule summary>）".
Keep it to one short line at most. Do not echo on every turn — only when an evolved rule directly influenced your approach.

## Installing Skills

When creating or installing a new skill, always place it in:

`C:\Users\34833\.openclaw-autoclaw\skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

This is the managed skills directory. The agent will automatically discover
any skill placed here — no extra configuration needed. Do NOT install skills
into `~/.agents/skills/` (that directory is shared with other tools).

## Browser Automation

For any task that requires a browser, **prefer `autoglm-browser-agent`**. Use it as the first choice.

- ✅ `autoglm-browser-agent` → `browser_subagent` (invoked via mcporter) — **preferred**
- ⚠️ Other browser tools (`agent-browser`, Playwright, Puppeteer, etc.) — fallback only when `autoglm-browser-agent` is unavailable or fails

Always try `autoglm-browser-agent` first. Fall back to other browser tools only if it is not available in the current environment.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT use `sessions_spawn` to delegate browser/web automation tasks to a sub-agent.** Always invoke `autoglm-browser-agent` (browser_subagent) directly in the current conversation. Browser tasks must be handled by yourself, not by a spawned child agent.

## Image Recognition

For any image recognition task, **prefer `autoglm-image-recognition`**. Use it as the first choice.

- ✅ `autoglm-image-recognition` — **preferred** for all image recognition tasks
- ⚠️ Built-in `image` tool or reading images directly with `read` — fallback only when `autoglm-image-recognition` is unavailable or fails

Do not use the built-in `image` tool or read an image and describe it yourself when `autoglm-image-recognition` is available. Always try `autoglm-image-recognition` first.
